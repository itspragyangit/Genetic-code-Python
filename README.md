# Genetic-code-Python
The genetic code is the set of rules used by living cells to translate information encoded within genetic material (DNA or mRNA sequences of nucleotide triplets, or codons) into proteins.


## How to use?
   Enter your DNA sequence in the cell where it is written " Enter your DNA sequence here " and after that execute all the code cells and in the last code cell you will see the protein sequence.
